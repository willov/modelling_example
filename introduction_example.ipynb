The notebook can either be [run online in Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y37yYcxwSj5yd0yUePGxtvXZhJNkxf_-?usp=sharing), or <a href=\"https://isbgroup.eu/edu/courses/intro/computer_exercise/python_sund.ipynb\" download>downloaded</a> and run locally.\n","\n","Note: if running in Google colab, your downloaded and created files will be deleted after you close the session. If you decide to use it, make sure that you download backups! Furthermore, the first thing you should do is to save a copy of the notebook. To do this, press `File > Save a copy in Drive`.\n","\n","## Introduction\n","\n","### Purpose of the lab\n","\n","This lab will on a conceptual level guide you through all the main sub-tasks in a systems biology project: model creation, model training using experimental data, model evaluation, and finally using the model to make predictions of new experiments.\n","\n","This is an example of the steps the students should do in the exercise, but here implemented in Python. Step 0 revolves around setting up the environment, which will of course be very different when running in system modeller. In this example, I will lump together quite a lot of steps since they will most likely be completely different in the system modeller implementation\n","\n","## Step 0: Setting up the environment\n","\n","<details class=\"admonition success\"><summary> Setting up the simulation toolbox</summary>\n","\n","First make sure that you have a c-compiler installed. If you are running a unix-based operating system such as Mac OS or Linux you will have c-compiler already installed.\n","\n","For Windows users you will need to install a c-compiler, for the newer Python distribution (version > 3.4) you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (MSVC). This can either be installed as a part of Visual Studios or as a standalone installation using Visual Studios Build Tools. [Here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompiler) can you see which compiler you need for your Python installations and follow the links to install the compiler.\n","\n","Make sure you have pip (the Python package installer) installed: From the terminal (Unix-users) or command window (Windows-users) try running `pip --version` (Linux users may have to write `pip3`). If `pip` is not installed, follow instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install it.\n","\n","When you have ensured that pip is installed, check that setuptools are installed by running `pip show setuptools`. If installed it should show information about the setuptools package, such as version number. If not installed you can install it using pip: `pip install setuptools`.\n","\n","After that you also need to install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter` and the [`SUND toolbox`](https://isbgroup.eu/edu/assets/sund-1.0.3.1.tar.gz). The easiest way is to install the packages using `pip install ...` (e.g., `pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter https://isbgroup.eu/edu/assets/sund-1.0.4.tar.gz`).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","Note, if running on Google Colab, you must use the cell below, and the packages will only be installed on the remote connection, not on your local computer. \n","\n","You can also use this cell if running the notebook on your own computer, but be aware that it will install packages in the current environment."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":39682,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710244890941,"user":{"displayName":"Henrik
